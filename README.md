# Static-And-Modal-Analysis-in-Python
University project assignment. Implementation of the finite element method for static calculations of deformations and natural vibration shapes of frame structures using beam elements. Discretization and definition of material parameters are done by editing a text file. Analysis results are consistent with Ansys.
